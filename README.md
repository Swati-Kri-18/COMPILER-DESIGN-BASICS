DESCRIBTION-> This project is a basic yet educational implementation of a mini-compiler in C++ that is capable of parsing and evaluating simple arithmetic expressions. It focuses on one of the most fundamental components of compiler design â€” the expression evaluation phase. The primary goal of this project is to simulate how a real compiler interprets arithmetic expressions by performing lexical analysis, parsing, and computation, following the standard rules of operator precedence and associativity.

-> This project has been developed as part of a Compiler Design internship assignment and serves as a strong demonstration of theoretical knowledge applied in practical coding. It is designed to help beginners understand how parsing and evaluating expressions work under the hood of a compiler.

-> The program accepts arithmetic expressions as input from the user via the command line, parses them using a recursive descent parser, and then evaluates them to return the result. The parser respects mathematical rules such as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), allowing proper grouping with parentheses and supporting both integer and floating-point values.

ðŸŽ¯ Features -> Supports basic arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /

-> Handles nested and grouped expressions using parentheses

-> Allows both integers and decimal numbers as input

-> Evaluates expressions in real-time (interactive REPL mode)

-> Handles errors such as division by zero or missing brackets

-> Uses recursive functions to parse and evaluate expressions

-> Designed for cross-platform use (Linux/Windows)

ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated -> Lexical Analysis: Skips whitespaces, reads digits, and detects tokens

-> Parsing: Implements a recursive descent parser following a simplified grammar

-> Operator Precedence: Ensures multiplication/division is evaluated before addition/subtraction

-> Expression Trees (implicit): Mimics the structure of an expression tree in recursive logic

-> Compiler Design Principles: Highlights the evaluation phase of compilation
